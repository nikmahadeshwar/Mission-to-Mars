# Mission-to-Mars

## Background
Building a Web Application that  will scrapes various images of Mars’s hemispheres online. Then adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. I have used  BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, used a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
